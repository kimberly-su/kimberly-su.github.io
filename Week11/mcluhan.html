            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>In Marshall McLuhan's zine, The Medium is the Massage, he emphasizes that when messages are being conveyed, the medium is sometimes more significant than the actual message itself.</p>
            <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                <p>McLuhan's insight really made me think about if it applied to the way I absorbed information provided to me. After thinking for a while, I definitely think it does. The best example I can think of is podcasts. For me, listening to a podcast versus watching a video of the people recording the podcast are entirely different experiences.</p>
