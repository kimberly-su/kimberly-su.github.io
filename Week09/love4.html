    <h1>
        Developed for Netscape 2, LOVE is a series of seven stories arranged in a navigable grid of HTML files. Images, text, and interactive compositions map a range of experiences associated with romantic love, from innocent longing to polymorphous perversion to bitter loss. The user navigates the work via a nonlinear path, but the work retains a loose narrative arc nevertheless.

        Personal experience: When we were navigating these pages, and had difficulty understanding how the webpage was nonlinear, but when we scrolled down, we saw that there was a series of numbers linked to different pages. Each page brought you to something different, ranging from something cute to something extremely explicit.
