        <center>Dr. Vannevar Bush served as the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. During this time, he oversaw the actions of approximately six thousand American scientists for the implementation of science to warfare. In this article, “As We May Think”, Bush discusses what he thinks will be the future for scientists after the war. Throughout the article, he talks about several inventions and how they may be modernized in the future. For example, he talks about recording information and how it went from pencil and paper to a typewriter. What is next for this method?</center>

        <center>It was a bit alarming reading this article knowing that it was from 1945 because so many of the things Bush predicted are true in our world today. We have HD TVs, text-to-speech systems, and high quality cameras built right into our phones. One of the main inventions that Bush dreams of is a way to compress information so you can store it in your back pocket. Well, now we have smartphones to do that. I think Bush would be very pleased if he was able to see what we have accomplished today.
